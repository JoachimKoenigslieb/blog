## 4 billion if statements.

You [might have read the blog](https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io//jekyll/update/2023/12/27/4-billion-if-statements.html) exploring the funny TikTok video of writing an `isEven` function using explicit comparisons. 
It was found that you can actually run these 4 billion if statements in approximately 10 seconds! Pretty wild. It does
seem like the programmed is bottlenecked by actually loading all the billions of instructions into memory, which is tough. I 
I thought we could try to speed this up a bit. To keep it in the spirit of the original program, we will still use explicit
checks for evenness. 

### Writing the program

I actually wanted to have a baseline comparison of a huge program with all the explicit comparisons written out, like in the
original blog post. But my computer is an M2 chip, and the arm-64 instruction set is a lot more iffy to write out, so I 
I did not have any luck writing a comparable Python compiler. Instead, we will have our baseline as "just a loop.".
But to actually have the eveness be checked explicitly, we will check against *all* the even numbers, and then against *all* 
the odd numbers. The C code will look something like this:

```
    int isOdd = 0;
    int isEven = 0;

    for (u_int32_t i = 1; i<UINT32_MAX; i=i+2) {
        // checking all the odd numbers...
        if (i == test_case) {
            isOdd += 1;
        }
    }

    // the max value we can have in whatever bit-width is 2**n - 1, this means we WILL skip over this
    for (u_int32_t i = 0; i<(UINT32_MAX-1); i=i+2) {
        if (i == test_case) {
            // checking all the even numbers...
            isEven += 1;
        }
    }
```

This actually has big potential for a very annoying and subtle bug: In the even case it is very easy to "overshoot" and
cause an integer overflow! 

Running this program takes about 7 seconds on my machine. It is going to be pretty hard to directly compare the setup in the blog
but if someone is interested in writing out a program that can run on an M2 chip that explicitly checks in the spirit of the
original post by `andreasjhkarlsson`, you can submit a [PR here](https://github.com/JoachimKoenigslieb/fast-if-else), and I will add it to the benchmarks!

## Improving performance

This program is extremely "embarrassingly parellelizable.". All the checks are independent! Because I could not get OpenMP
to compile in a reasonable amount of time for a project like this, I decided to just raw-dog a threaded version myself. 
Here I show results running on 8 threads (as that is the amount of physical high-performance cores on this chip). This 
gives a speed-up of about 5-6 times compared to the naive version (or, about an infinite slowdown compared to checking the LSB...)!

But looking at that Apple promo material, it seems we might be able to do better. We have both a GPU and a (quite mysterious) TPU on
SOC. Writing code targeting GPUs is never trivial, but it seems like we could be following along with [this great blog post about compiling C++ code
to Metal shaders](https://larsgeb.github.io/2022/04/20/m1-gpu.html). That's a project for another time...
