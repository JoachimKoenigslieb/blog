## New years betting

Every year the queen of Denmark has held an annual new years speech. Recently, I've realized that you can bet money on specific words used in this speech. 
Additionally, you can also bet if she will use specific words *at-least* some number of times. I thought this was interresting, and that maybe, we can do some statistics.

First we can start by gathering historical speeches made by the Queen. Turns out there is a danish comapny, Danske Taler, that convientently has collected these speeches for us.
We can find them by going to https://www.dansketaler.dk/soeg?q=Dronning+Magrethe+nyt%C3%A5rstale. Downloading the speeches we can start exploring the data.
