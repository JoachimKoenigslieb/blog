import {GribMap} from '@/components/GribMap'

## Grib files in the browser???
It turns out that [the idea discussed briefly]() on the ECMWF Code for Earth challenge page is actually sort of possible

Hooking together a stack of
- https://github.com/BlueNetCat/grib22json
- and Deck.gl with mapbox libre

We get something that just sort-of works out of the box:

<GribMap />

There is obviously some sort of defect in the latitude, where is seems everything is shifted somehow. 

Potentially this GRIB file I found somewhere randomly has some quality issues. Or maybe there is a more serious project issue.
The https://github.com/BlueNetCat/grib22json parser is... A bit rough (And my half-assed attempt at turning it into Typescript did **not** help!). Something could definitely go wrong there. It could be very interresting
to see how far you can push this. Could this actually be a viable alternative to Panoply?
